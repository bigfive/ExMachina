## RUN SHEET OF A NEURON

1) Wait for all inputs to send activities (remember these connections)
1) Compute activity
1) Compute weighted activities
1) Send to weighted activities to outputs
1) Wait for all output responses. (IE the dE/dz of each connected output neuron)
1) Compute dE/dz (via dE/dy)
1) Send dE/dz back to open connections from step 1
1) Compute dE/dw
1) Update weights
